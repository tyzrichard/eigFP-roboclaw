# EIG Foundational Programme 2024!
Under the NP Engineering Interest Group (EIG), our group consisting of Richard Tan, Lohith Tanuku, and Denzel Teo undertook EIG's signature Foundational Project, an ambitious 3-parter course that teaches participants the following:
1. 3D Modelling and Fabrication using Fusion360
2. Microcontroller Programming using the Arduino Leonardo
3. Wireless Communication to a simple app made in MIT App Inventor\

Our task was to combine our learnt knowledge from the three courses to make a Claw Bot that can turn around and stretch its arm out to grab an item.\
This Github Repo contains the very code we used to power our robot + wire connections.
